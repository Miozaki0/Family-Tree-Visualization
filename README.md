# Family-Tree-Visualization

# Family Tree Visualization Project
## Data Analysis & Visualization | Python | Graph Theory | NetworkX | Graphviz

### Objective:
Developed a family tree visualization system by processing personal and relationship data through a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm and generating an interactive family tree graph using Python.

### Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NetworkX, Graphviz)
- BFS Algorithm
- Data Manipulation
- Graph Visualization

### Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented a function to process BFS output into a structured family tree table using Pandas.
- Used NetworkX to construct the relationships between individuals (parents, children, and spouses) and Graphviz for the graphical representation of family trees.
- Applied advanced data cleaning techniques to ensure relationships like "no_entry" placeholders were not visualized, optimizing the clarity of the graph.
- Visualized family structures dynamically, offering insights into generational relationships and family hierarchies.

### Outcome:
Delivered a user-friendly family tree representation, useful for genealogical analysis, data-driven storytelling, and exploring family structures visually.
